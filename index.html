<figcaption>This is a dog and a wolf</figcaption>
      <p>

A wolf there was, whose scanty fare
Had made his person lean and spare;
A dog there was, so amply fed,
His sides were plump and sleek; 'tis said
The wolf once met this prosp'rous cur,
And thus began: "Your servant, sir;
I'm pleased to see you look so well,
Though how it is I cannot tell;
I have not broke my fast to-day;
Nor have I, I'm concern'd to say,
One bone in store or expectation,
And that I call a great vexation."

"Indeed it is," the dog replied:
"I know no ill so great beside;
But if you do not like to be
So poorly fed, come live with me."
"Agreed," rejoined the wolf, "I'll go:
But pray, what work am I to do?"
"Oh, guard the house, and do not fail
To bark at thieves, and wag your tail."

So off they jogg'd, and soon arrived
At where the friendly mastiff lived.
"Well," said the wolf, "I can't deny
You have a better house than I."
"Not so," the other then replied,
"If you with me will hence abide."
"Oh," said the wolf, "how kind you are!
But what d'ye call that, hanging there?
Is it an iron chain, or what?"
"Friend," said the dog, "I quite forgot
To mention that; sometimes, you see,
They hook that little chain to me;
But it is only meant to keep
Us dogs from walking in our sleep,
And should you wear it, you would find,
It's nothing that you need to mind."

"I'll take your word," the wolf replied.
"It's truth by me shall ne'er be tried;
I'll have my liberty again,
And you your collar and your chain."
</p>
<p>
MORAL...
</P>
<p>
Our neighbors sometimes seem to be
A vast deal better off than we;
Yet seldom 'tis they really are,
Since they have troubles too to bear,
Which, if the truth were really known,
Are quite as grievous as our own.

  <h1>The man and the lion</h1>

  <figcaption>This is a lion</figcaption>
  <p>

A man and a lion once had a dispute,
Which was reckon'd the greatest, the man or the brute;
The lion discoursed on his side at some length,
And greatly enlarged on his courage and strength.

The man, one would think, had enough to reply
On his side the question, which none could deny;
But like many others who make a pretence,
He talk'd perfect nonsense, and thought it good sense.

"So," says he, "don't be prating,—look yonder, I pray,
At that sculpture of marble, now what will you say?
The lion is vanquished; but as for the man
He is striding upon him; deny it who can."

"But pray," said the lion, "who sculptured that stone?"
"One of us," said the man, "I must candidly own."
"But when we are sculptors," the other replied,
"You will then on the man see the lion astride."
</p>
<p>
MORAL...
</p>
<p>
The man might have added, if he had been wise,
"But a beast cannot sculpture a stone, if he tries."
That sufficiently shows where the difference lies.</p>

      <h1>The fox and the crane</h1>

      <figcaption>This is a fox</figcaption>
      <p>

"I certainly think," said a fox to a crane,
"That face, ma'am of yours is remarkably plain;
That beak that you wear is so frightful a feature,
It makes you appear a most singular creature."
The crane, much offended at what she had heard,
March'd off at full speed, without saying a word:
[19]"Oh dear!" said the fox, "Mrs. Crane, I protest
You misunderstand me, 'twas only a jest."
"Come, don't be affronted—stay with me and dine;
You know very well 'tis this temper of mine
To say such odd things to my intimate friends;
But you know that poor Reynard no mischief intends."
So the crane thought it best not to break with him quite,
But to view his remarks in a good-natured light.
So she put on as pleasant a face as she could
When he ask'd her to dine, and replied that she would.
But alas! she perceived that his jokes were not over,
When Reynard removed from the victuals its cover
[20]'Twas neither game, butcher's meat, chicken, not fish;
But plain gravy-soup, in a broad shallow dish.
Now this the fox lapp'd with his tongue very quick,
While the crane could scarce dip in the point of her beak;
"You make a poor dinner," said he to his guest;
"Oh, dear! by no means," said the bird, "I protest."
But the crane ask'd the fox on a subsequent day,
When nothing, it seems, for their dinner had they
But some minced meat served up in a narrow-neck'd jar;
Too long, and narrow, for Reynard by far.
"You make a poor dinner, I fear," said the bird;
"Why, I think," said the fox, "'twould be very absurd
To deny what you say, yet I cannot complain,
But confess, though a fox, that I'm matched by a crane."
</P>
<p>
MORAL...
</p>
<p>
Cunning folks who play tricks which good manners condemn,
Often find their own tricks play'd again upon them.

  <p>

Two friends once were walking in sociable chat,
When a purse one espied on the ground;
"Oh, see!" said he, (thank my fortune for that,)
"What a large sum of money I've found!"

"Nay, do not say I" said his friend, "for you know
'Tis but friendship to share it with me;"
"I share it with you," said the other. "How so?
He who found it the owner should be."

"Be it so," said his friend, "but what sound do I hear?
'Stop thief!' one is calling to you;
He comes with a constable close in the rear!"
Said the other, "Oh, what shall we do?"

"Nay, do not say we," said his friend, "for you know
You claimed the sole right to the prize!
And since all the money was taken by you,
With you the dishonesty lies."
</p>
<p>
MORAL...
</P>
<P>
When people are selfish, dishonest, and mean,
Their nature, in dealing, will quickly be seen.

  <h1>The Milkmade</h1>
  <img src="images/milkmaid.png" alt="drawing of a milkmade">
  <figcaption>This is a milkmade</figcaption>
  <p>

A milkmaid, who poized a full pail on her head,
Thus mused on her prospects in life, it is said:
"Let's see—I should think that this milk will procure
One hundred good eggs, or fourscore to be sure.

"Well then—stop a bit,—it must not be forgotten,
Some of these may be broken, and some may be rotten;
But if twenty for accidents should be detach'd,
It will leave me just sixty sound eggs to hatch'd.

"Well, sixty sound eggs—no; sound chickens, I mean;
Of these some may die—we'll suppose seventeen—
Seventeen!—not so many—say ten at the most,
Which will leave fifty chickens to boil or to roast.

"But then there's their barley; how much will they need?
Why they take but one grain at a time when they feed,
[36]So that's a mere trifle; now then let us see,
At a fair market price, how much money there'll be?

"Six shillings a pair—five—four—three-and-six,
To prevent all mistakes, that low price I will fix;
Now what will that make? fifty chickens, I said,
Fifty times three-and-sixpence—I'll ask brother Ned.

"Oh! but stop—three-and-sixpence a pair I must sell 'em;
Well, a pair is a couple—now then let us tell 'em;
A couple in fifty will go—(my poor brain!)
Why just a score times, and five pair will remain.

"Twenty-five pair of fowls—now how shameful it is,
That I can't reckon up as much money as this!
Well, there's no use in trying; so let's give a guess;
I will say twenty pounds, and it can't be no less.

"Twenty pounds, I am certain, will buy me a cow,
Thirty geese, and two turkeys—eight pigs and a sow;
Now if these turn out well, at the end of the year,
I shall fill both my pockets with guineas 'tis clear.

"Then I'll bid that old tumble-down hovel good-bye;
My mother she'll scold, and my sisters they'll cry:
But I won't care a crow's egg for all they can say;
I sha'n't go to stop with such beggars as they!"

But forgetting her burden, when this she had said,
The maid superciliously toss'd up her head
[38]When alas! for her prospects—the milk pail descended!
And so all her schemes for the future were ended.
</p>
<p>
MORAL...
</p>
<p>
This moral, I think, may be safely attach'd:
Reckon not on your chickens before they are hatch'd.</p>
